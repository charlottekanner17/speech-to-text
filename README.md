# speech-to-text



Here are my expansive thoughts. 
My video only had four words so I would say that this was useful. It is hard to tell in terms of how this might do with videos that have more words in them but this can be useuful in transcribing videos, especially with longer videos. Overall, the process wasn't too long but if you don't know how to code and use a tool like this, I am sure that there are other platforms that can complete the same task.
